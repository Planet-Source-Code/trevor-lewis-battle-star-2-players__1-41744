### Description

This is like the game "Battle Ships" except it uses star ships of different shapes. Demonstrates BitBlt, Winsock & Simple Messaging Methods. Has been tested over the internet and Lan's. Just interested to find out what everyone thinks of this. This game is 100% complete !!!
 
### More Info
 
The program may take some time to load up, as it generates all the ships during startup.
